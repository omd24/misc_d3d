# misc_d3d
Miscellaneous samples with Direct3D12 with a bit more intermediate level of complexity
The techniques implemented here include (but not limited to):
- bluring effect and sobel operator with compute shaders
- Tree billboarding using geometry shaders
- Planar shadow with stenciling 
- BÃ©zier surface using tessellation stages
- 

The following video (uploaded on YouTube) shows the most interesting demo of this repo:
